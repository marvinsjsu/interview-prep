### Rendering Patterns

#### Core Web Vitals
Allows us to measure the performance of a website and can help us identify areas for improvement.  Performance of a website is important because it can affect SEO.

- TTFB (Time to First Byte): time it takes for a client to receive the first byte of page content

- FCP (First Contentful Paint): time it takes the browser to render the first piece of content after navigation

- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): time it takes to load and render the page's main content

- TTI (Time to Interactive): time from when the page starts loading to when it's reliably responding to user input quickly

- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): measures visual stability to avoid unexpected layout shift

- FIP (First Input Delay): time from when the user interacts with the page to the time when the event handlers are able to run

We can use Lighthouse in our Chrome dev console or go to web.dev to get analysis of website performance and suggestions on how we can improve the page.
