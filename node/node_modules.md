### `node_modules`
We start our project with `npm init`, which creates a `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `node_modules` folder.

`node_modules` contains the source code of all of our dependencies (packages that we have installed via `npm i [package_name]`).  Each dependency will have its own dependency tree, but each dependency will have its own folder and not nested (flat folder structure), to avoid duplication (which was the case in early version of `npm`).  We don't share `node_modules`, instead we share `package.json` or better yet, `package-lock.json`.

`package-lock.json` is automatically generated whenever `node_modules` is modified.  

#### Semantic Versioning
- `major`.`minor`.`patch`
   - `major` is for breaking changes
   - `minor` is for non-breaking changes, adding functionality that is backwards compatible
   - `path` is for non-breaking bug-fixes
   - `^`
      - if there is a major version, then this will match the minor version and all minor versions above, within the major version
   - `~`
      - this matches all patch versions
