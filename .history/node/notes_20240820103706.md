### Node

This is a runtime environment built for JavaScript.  This has `global` object instead of `window`, which is what browsers provide us.

#### `argv`
A property on `process` that gives us an array of arguments.  The first element will always be the path of the Node process.  The second will be the path of the JavaScript file being executed.  The next elements will be additional command-line arguments.

```
> process.argv
[ '/Users/marvinmante/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.0/bin/node' ]
```


#### Node vs JavaScript


##### LTS (Long-Term Support version)
- gives us developers time to use a stable version of Node
- even release numbers will be LTS (active and maintenance phase)
    - active means it being actively supported
    - maintenance means it will only receive bug fixes

##### REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
