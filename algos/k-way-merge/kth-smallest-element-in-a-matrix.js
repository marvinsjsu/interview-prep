/**
 * Kth Smallest Element in a Matrix
 * 
 * Find the kth smallest element in an (n x n) matrix, 
 * where each row and column of the matrix is sorted 
 * in ascending order.
 * 
 * 
 * Although there can be repeating values in the matrix, 
 * each element is considered unique and, therefore, 
 * contributes to calculating the kth smallest 
 * element.
